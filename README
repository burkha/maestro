Maestro is the name for the package containing two complimentary utilities for
musical composition. First, a C++, Bison based parser and renderer designed to
read .mae files and output wavs. Secondly, a Python library designed to
facilitate the creation of mae files within a Python program.

The "mae" language was designed with the following rules in mind: 1) simplicity
over minimizing verbosity, 2) line breaks and spacing are irrelevant.

The Python composition environment was designed to ease composition process by
providing a layer of abstraction over the musical notes themselves.
